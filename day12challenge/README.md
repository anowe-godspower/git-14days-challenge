## What will I be learning

Today we will be leaning how to work with GitHub Desktop

#### Brief Overview

GitHub Desktop is a GUI that empowers *lazy* users who prefer not to work with the CLI to still interface with Git and GitHub.

## Tasks

- Download GitHub desktop
- Create a new repository on GitHub
- Add anything you feel is EPIC! to your repo
- Follow through all the GitHub workflow you know using the GUI (commit, branching, pulling, pushing etc)

## How to Submit


- create your submission file e.g prosper-day12.md in your forked `git-14days-challenge`(i.e the devc repo your forked and cone)
- Add screenshots of of your use of GitHub GUI to your submission file

> Remember to fork this repo if you've not previously and create a new branch for your submission

Looking forward to reviewing your PR!
